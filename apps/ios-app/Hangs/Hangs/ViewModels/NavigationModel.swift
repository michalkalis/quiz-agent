//  Issue #111 (navigation as owned state). Owns the pushed-stack path for
//  ContentView's single root NavigationStack, replacing the old notification
//  broadcast + view-identity-reset bridge. Teardown is reactive: it
//  clears whenever `quizState` ENTERS `.startingQuiz` (not merely "leaves
//  .idle" — see issue-111 gate note 1), which makes it structurally impossible
//  to start a quiz (voice, error-retry, or any of the 9 `startNewQuiz` sites)
//  without also tearing the pushed stack down.
