# Catchup Command

Resume work after a break by understanding recent changes.

## Instructions

1. Find the base branch (main or develop) and compare current branch against it
2. Read all files that have changed in the current git branch
3. Summarize:
   - What was done (features, fixes, refactors)
   - What likely needs to happen next
   - Any incomplete work or TODOs found in the changes
4. If on main/develop branch with no changes, summarize the last 3-5 commits instead
